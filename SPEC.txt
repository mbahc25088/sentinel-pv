VERSION DOOM — SPEC.txt

PHASE 0 — CONTRACT & INVARIANTS
STATUS: LOCKED

This SPEC.txt is the single source of truth for the entire project.
All code, files, schemas, and behavior are judged against this document.

========================
GLOBAL PROJECT INVARIANTS
========================

- Scope: FULL from day one. No MVP reduction.
- Depth target: 1000× behavioral depth via dense logic.
- No placeholders, stubs, or TODO logic.
- No MedDRA dependency; internal ontology only.
- Human-in-the-loop mandatory for all regulatory decisions.

========================
FILE CHANGE RULE
========================

- ANY file change requires FULL FILE REPLACEMENT.
- No partial snippets or diffs allowed.
- Filenames and paths are immutable once locked.

========================
SPEC GOVERNANCE
========================

- SPEC.txt is authoritative.
- Updated after every phase AND every subsection.
- Must include:
  - Phase number and lock status
  - Exact frozen file tree
  - Per-file purpose and responsibilities
  - Line-level intent summaries
  - Contracts (inputs/outputs/invariants)
  - What changed vs previous phase

========================
TECH STACK (LOCKED)
========================

Backend:
- Python
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL (single system of record)
- SQLAlchemy
- Docker + docker-compose

Frontend:
- React + TypeScript
- Dark-mode first
- Strict backend contract consumption

========================
PRIMARY LIFECYCLE GATE
========================

INIT → OBSERVE → ANALYZE → GOVERNED → EXPORTABLE

- Signals cannot skip states.
- Gate enforced across DB, API, UI, audit.

========================
PHASE STRUCTURE (LOCKED)

========================
DELIVERY & VERIFICATION
========================

- Delivery model: Option A only.
- Assistant delivers code.
- User uploads full project ZIP after each phase.
- Assistant verifies every file and every line against SPEC.

========================
EMOTIONAL CONSTRAINT
========================

Project failure causes significant emotional distress.
Reliability and alignment are hard constraints.

========================
PHASE 0 — LOCK CONFIRMATION
========================

Phase 0 is LOCKED.
No future phase may violate these rules unless explicitly unlocked by the user.
